            Even though we are not using the `React` variable directly, it has to be included to use the JSX syntax

    +code_focus('3-7').current-only
        :markdown-it
            Most common React components are simple functions that return some markup

    +code_focus('5').current-only
        | Here, JSX, is returned

    +code_focus('9').current-only
        :markdown-it
            Make sure the function is exported from the file, so we can use it in other files.
